# finance.adriant.io

<https://finance.adriant.io> is my personal finance blog built using Jekyll and hosted on Github-pages.

# Run the web application

```
docker-compose up
```

For convenience use the provided `docker-compose` script which performs the following steps:
1. Builds the Docker image from the [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile)
2. Mounts the current directory into the Docker container working directory to enable `livereload`
3. Exposes the application port `4000` and livereload port `35729`

## Known Issues
Seems like `livereload` doesn't work on Windows and I already tried the suggestion from [this blog](https://httpain.com/blog/jekyll-live-reload-windows/). So just disable it for now.

# Deployment
Commits to the `master` branch will automatically trigger CI/CD defined in the [Github Actions](./.github/workflows/github-pages.yml). This will collect tags, build the jekyll site and commit the static site to the `gh-pages` branch.

# Contributing
	
## Drafting Posts
Add to `_drafts` with the file name format `YYYY-mm-dd-name-of-post.md`

Here's an example post. It should include the category, comma-delimitted tags,
and optionally a read more separator.

```
# ---
layout: post
categories: aws kubernetes
tags: s3 eks
---

Hello I'm here to talk about s3 and eks.

When the post is ready to be published, move it to `_posts`.

## \_includes helpers

### image.html
Use this to embed an image.
```
{% include image.html file=FILE[, alt=ALT, width=WIDTH, height=HEIGHT] %}
```

## Adding new gems
```
$ bundle add <gem>
```

If it is a jekyll plugin, you may need to add it to the `plugins` section in `_config.yml`

# Gotchas
Not all jekyll plugins are supported by Github pages. I guess it makes sense, they don't read the Gemfile and install your deps, they just have a preset environment. Here's a list of supported plugins: https://pages.github.com/versions/
